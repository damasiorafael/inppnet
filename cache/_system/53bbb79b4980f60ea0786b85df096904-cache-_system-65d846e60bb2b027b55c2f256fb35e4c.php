Previous versions were using the database installation and update code in Joomla! itself which was notoriously    buggy and resulted in erratic behaviour. In this release we use our own database installer \\\\\\\/ updater for the base    tables of our component. Unfortunately, due to the rules in the Joomla! Extensions Directory, we still have to rely    on Joomla!'s code for the administrator menu item creation which may cause no menu item appearing    under components on very few sites. We are aware of it, we know how to fix it, but we are not allowed to on penalty    of being permanently banned from the directory!<\\\\\\\/p><p>    <b>Show the update information in the control panel page<\\\\\\\/b>. In the previous version we introduced the integration    with Joomla!'s own extensions updater. Unfortunately you could no longer see the update information in the    component's control panel page. This version fixes it and allows you to force-reload the update information if you    need to as Joomla! no longer lets you do that in the latest 3.x versions (for no good reason, really).<\\\\\\\/p><p>    <b>Better workaround for the misbehaving auto-complete feature of certain browsers<\\\\\\\/b> (e.g. Safari). Some browsers    would auto-complete passwords even when we specifically told them not to, by means of the autocomplete=\\\\\\\"off\\\\\\\"    attribute. Regrettably, Safari and some Firefox extensions ignored that with the effect of ending up with an ANGIE    password when you didn't expect one to be set. This was frustrating to our users who thought it's a bug with our    software. Thankfully, we found a good Javascript-based workaround! Also, whenever you are using an ANGIE password,    Akeeba Backup will warn you \\\\u2013 just in case your fingers slipped.<\\\\\\\/p><p>    <b>CLI script to receive update notification and, optionally, auto-update our software<\\\\\\\/b>. You can use this script    in a CRON job. It will send you update notification emails and, if you enable the option, automatically update our    component to the latest version as soon as it's made available.<\\\\\\\/p><p>    <b>Backup progress is shown in the browser tab<\\\\\\\/b>. If your browser supports setting the tab's icon we will show you    the backup progress as a tiny pie chart in the browser tab icon. This is useful when you're running backups of    several sites in different tabs and you want to see at a glance which ones are already finished.<\\\\\\\/p><p>    ...and a lot more minor improvements and bug fixes.<\\\\\\\/p><h3>Changelog<\\\\\\\/h3><h4>Bug fixes<\\\\\\\/h4><ul> <li>[HIGH] Accessing the component fails on Joomla! 3.2.x if the core database has not been updated<\\\\\\\/li> <li>[LOW] A tilde in the PHP version could cause a cosmetic error (a warning printed out) during restoration.
